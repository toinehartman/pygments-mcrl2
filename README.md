# mCRL2 Pygments lexer

This a custom [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) lexer for [mCRL2](https://www.mcrl2.org/web/user_manual/index.html). It provides lexing of model (`*.mcrl2`) and requirement (`*.mcf`) files.

It can be used in LaTeX locally and on Overleaf by following [these instructions](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Code_Highlighting_with_minted#Custom_lexers). For use with Overleaf, it is required to set TexLive to **version 2020** in the project settings.
